                    Whether our plants start out as seeds or clones (clones def) their journeys begin here in The Veg Room. As they sprout and root our plants go through much of their lives in this area. Transitioning from the domes into their own cups each plant is assigned it’s own unique barcode and number, this way each plant’s life can individually be tracked. From the top shelves as they begin to outgrow their little cups, they are transplanted into a pot. At this juvenile stage they remain on the left side of the Veg Room until they reach maturity. Once again it is time to transition, this time into a larger pot. This is their final upgrade on their way to becoming mature plants. In their last pots and moved to the right side of the Veg Room they begin their vegetative state (def). Now our plants have one of two places to go. Either they continue their journey on the way to The Flower Room or if their genetics are outstanding, they become a mother plant (def). Mother plants will live out their lives here in the Veg Room giving life to multiple generations of new clones.

                Continuing this journey our mature plants are moved into The Flower Room. Here in The Flower Room we have space for hundreds of plants to embark from a vegetative state on the flowering process. Our light is applied in just the right ways to ensure optimal conditions for each plant. Our set up of lights allows for multiple stages of flowering growth to increase our amounts of harvest cycles. Here we are, fully flowered and at the very end of our growth journey.
